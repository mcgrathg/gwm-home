  'I have developed hundreds of Enterprise web applications in the last few years. Many are designed to solve complex corporate tasks by incorporating multiple permission levels, hierarchical/tree-like grids, reactive layouts, and complex data queries, while others are as simple as a single editable grid.',
  'My goal for developing software is to create solutions for many of the user\'s challenges. I work hard with my clients to produce usable, intuitive, and helpful software that converts difficult procedures into simple tasks. I do not cut corners or take shortcuts; my software is written to be flexible and thorough in order to create the best user experience.  Not only is this essential for today\'s use, but it builds a solid foundation that can easily be adjusted for future improvements.',
